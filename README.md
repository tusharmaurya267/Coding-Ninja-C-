# CODING NINJA C++ PRACTISE QUESTION


# Disclaimer:-

Copying codes from here and pasting it on Coding Ninja’s console won’t help you. This is to enhance knowledge and get your codes more optimized.


# Contribution Guidelines:- 

If you have got an optimized solution to a problem or, let’s say, the existing solution is failing on some test cases and you got a working solution, then there is really a high chance of getting you pull request being accepted. Note: If you have got an optimised solution, but the existing solution is also working, then:
1.	Make another file in the corresponding folder.

2.	Name it <problem name>-<your name>-Optimized.cpp. for example, if the problem name is Angry Children, then name of the file which will contain the optimized code should be Angry_Children-Tushar_Maurya-Optimized.cpp

3.	Generate a pull request and wait.
